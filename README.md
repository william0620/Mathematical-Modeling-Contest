# USA Mathematical Modeling Contests
Including Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) && The International Mathematical Modeling Challenge (IMMC) && HiMCM I finished in Shanghai Experimental School. 
## Thanks to my two best teammates and my mentor Chen Xiaming.
This repo also includes two essays I finished in Hangzhou Dianzi University. I completed my last math modeling essay 10.25.2021 and decided to finish my math modeling career. Again, thanks to Chen Xiaming, who brought me into this great field, I could have the chance to cooperate with those most talented young man in China, which improve my maths skill and the ability to coding for a great distance.
